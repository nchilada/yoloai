# Host Directory Layout

The CLI splits `~/.yoloai/` into two namespaces: `library/` (everything the
embeddable engine owns — what the library `Layout` is pointed at) and `cli/`
(CLI-only app state). The split is a CLI convention; an embedder that passes an
explicit `DataDir` gets the engine subtree directly under that path, with no
`library/` segment (see D60). Each namespace carries its own plain-text-integer
`.schema-version` stamp.

**Startup gate (D61).** The root `PersistentPreRunE` runs a read-only migration
gate (`internal/cli/gate.go`) before any command touches the data dir. It
create-freshes a genuinely new install (absent/empty `TOP`), fails fast with
"run `yoloai system migrate`" when a realm is out of date, surfaces an
inconsistent-data-dir error when exactly one realm is uninitialized, or proceeds.
It never migrates silently — all mutation of an existing dir lives in the
explicit `yoloai system migrate` command (`internal/cli/system/migrate.go`).
`version`, `help`, `completion`, and `migrate` are gate-exempt via the
`cliutil.AnnotationSkipMigrationGate` annotation.

`library/` is what the library `Layout` resolves to (or the embedder's explicit
`DataDir`):

## The sandbox dir is tiered by guest access

A sandbox directory is exactly three physical tiers — `host/` (never shared), `ro/`
(guest-read), `rw/` (guest-read-write) — so that a file's guest-access class is **where it
sits**, not an entry on a list that has to be maintained. There is no un-tiered place at the
root to put a new file. The invariant:

> **Host-only state is never inside a guest-visible region, and the guest reaches each
> region at the narrowest access it needs.**

Docker upholds it by binding named items and never the sandbox root; tart and seatbelt now
uphold it too, which is what closed DF136 and DF148 on every backend.

**Each backend expresses the tiers with what it has**, and the two mechanisms are not equally
strong:

- **docker, podman, containerd, apple** bind each needed file individually at its own
  read-only/read-write mode. The tiers never appear as directories in the guest, and `host/`
  is unreachable because nothing names it.
- **tart** publishes one VirtioFS share per guest-facing tier (`ro` mounted `:ro`, `rw`
  read-write) and none for `host/`, which is therefore absent from the guest's namespace.
  Its read-only tier is a real read-only mount and holds unconditionally.
- **seatbelt** has no mount namespace — the sandboxed process sees the real directory — so
  every tier boundary is an SBPL rule. Grants are per tier, and both non-writable tiers carry
  an **explicit trailing deny**, because on seatbelt the absence of a grant is not a denial:
  it holds only while nothing broader grants the same access, and the profile grants broadly
  (the temp tree, the caches, any enclosing mount). That applies to reads as much as writes —
  `host/` is denied both (DF161, DF170).

yoloAI pre-populates a `home-seed` directory with agent-specific configs
and then mirrors that directory in the guest home
(again using a read-write bind for **docker, podman, containerd, apple**
and a symlink for **tart and seatbelt**).

**The guest always sees one flat root, and on the two directory-sharing backends that root is
the `rw/` tier itself**, with each `ro/` entry surfaced inside it as a *relative* symlink
(`rw/bin -> ../ro/bin`, assembled by `config.AssembleGuestView`). The in-sandbox scripts join
every path from a single directory and are deliberately untouched by tiering. Two consequences
worth knowing:

- **A relative link resolves on both sides.** In a tart guest the tiers are two shares named
  for their tiers under one mount, so `../ro/x` means the same file there as on the host. An
  absolute target could only ever be right on one side.
- **The host never reads through the view.** Every host-side path comes from the builders, so
  it addresses the real tier. A guest that deletes or replaces one of these links breaks only
  its own view — it cannot make the host read a file of its choosing, which is what keeps
  DF148 closed.

An entry no one has classified is moved to `host/`, loudly: that direction can only remove
guest access (a missing file, which gets reported), where defaulting to `rw/` would silently
hand the agent something nobody classified. Classification lives in one table,
`internal/config/sandbox_tier.go`, which is also the v5→v6 migration's specification.

Build paths with the `internal/config` helpers (`EnvironmentPath`, `BinPath`, …), never an
ad-hoc `filepath.Join` on a sandbox dir: the builder is what makes a file's tier a single
place to change, and a call site that re-derives the layout silently opts out of it. This is
not hypothetical tidiness — every defect found while finishing the tiering was an ad-hoc join
that kept compiling and started pointing at nothing.

Design, sequencing and per-backend detail:
[sandbox-share-tiering.md](../archive/plans/sandbox-share-tiering.md).

## Build-staleness markers are keyed by backend

Several paths above cache a "have I already built this?" checksum next to the thing it
describes — the global `cache/` base-image marker, and a `.last-build-checksum` in each profile
directory. **These markers must be keyed by the backend that wrote them**, because the artifact
they vouch for is not shared: docker, podman, containerd and apple each keep their own image
store, so a marker written by one backend answers a question about an image another backend does
not have.

Both do this today: `baseImageChecksumPath(layout, backendKey)` for the base image (DF56) and
`profileChecksumPath(profileDir, backendKey)` for profile images (DF150). The profile marker was
unqualified until 2026-07-27, and the failure was neither hypothetical nor rare — build a profile
under docker, run it under `--backend podman`, and podman skipped a build whose image it did not
have, then failed pulling a local-only tag. It failed in both directions, on any host with two
container backends.

The invariant generalizes past checksums: **any host-side marker that stands in for a
backend-managed artifact is keyed by backend, or it is a lie for every other backend.**

**And the key is a backend *name*, which is a proxy for a store rather than the store itself.**
Where one name means one store — apple, containerd — the proxy is exact. The docker backend can
be pointed at OrbStack, Docker Desktop or Colima, so it is not: `"docker"` names three possible
stores. The base image handles this by not relying on a host-side marker at all, stamping the
checksum onto the image (`baseChecksumLabel`) so staleness travels with the image into whatever
store holds it. **When the artifact can carry its own staleness, that beats any host-side
marker** — the marker is what you use when it cannot. The profile path cannot yet, and that gap is
[DF152](../design/findings-unresolved.md).
